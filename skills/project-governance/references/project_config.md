# Project Configuration

This skill consumes optional repository-owned configuration for
`defect-feedback-lifecycle`, `defect-diagnosis`, `defect-history-review`,
`document-audit`, `document-maintenance`, `domain-knowledge`,
`release-deployment`, `test-case-development`, and `port-allocation` through
the configuration mechanism supplied by `skillcraft`.
The mechanism belongs to `skillcraft`; it is not a Project Governance domain
or a Project-Skill Governance capability.

```text
.agents/skills-config/project-governance/
├── config.yaml
├── test-case-workflow.json
└── <profile>.md
```

The repository configuration above is distinct from the machine-local segment
registry:

```text
~/.agents/skills-config/project-governance/project-segments.yaml
```

The repository owns its selected segment and service map. The machine-local
registry prevents two local projects from selecting the same segment and lets
a new project obtain the lowest free segment. Do not copy the global registry
into a repository or commit it.

Schemas `project-governance.config.v1` and `v2` remain supported as legacy
composed-instruction profiles. Use `project-governance.config.v3` for
executable task contracts. Configure only supported tasks. `base` is relative
to the installed skill root; `profile` and `contract` are relative to the
repository configuration root.

```yaml
schema: project-governance.config.v3
profile: example-project
ports:
  project_segment: "42"
  instances:
    local_dev: 0
    local_e2e: 1
    local_preproduction: 2
    remote_preproduction: 5
    remote_production: 6
  services:
    allocation: sequential
    start: 0
    capacity: 100
    assignments:
      api: 0
      worker: 1
tasks:
  defect-feedback-lifecycle:
    base: references/defect-feedback-lifecycle.md
    profile: project-feedback.md
    contract: defect-feedback.contract.json
  defect-diagnosis:
    base: references/defect-governance.md
    profile: project-defects.md
    contract: defect-diagnosis.contract.json
  defect-history-review:
    base: references/defect-governance.md
    profile: project-defects.md
    contract: defect-history.contract.json
  document-maintenance:
    base: references/document-maintenance.md
    profile: project-documents.md
    contract: document-maintenance.contract.json
  release-deployment:
    base: references/release-deployment.md
    profile: project-release.md
    contract: release-deployment.contract.json
  port-allocation:
    base: references/port-allocation.md
    contract: port-allocation.contract.json
```

When `document-maintenance` is not configured, the skill supplies a managed
project-neutral contract with `inspect`, `plan`, `maintain`, and `verify` for
full-path maintenance. A single low-risk exact-record edit may use the
queryable-markdown fast path without invoking these project-wide operations.
Project configuration is required only when the repository needs different
governed roots, status vocabularies, or deterministic document commands. The
legacy `document-audit` task may remain configured during migration.

When `test-case-development` is not configured in `config.yaml`, the skill also
supplies a managed read-only contract with `inspect`, `plan`, and `verify`.
Catalog paths and schema mappings live in the independent sidecar below, so a
project does not need to adopt the PPISS-bearing v3 configuration merely to use
test cases. The `requirement_authority` field is an explicit project decision,
not a value inferred from requirement-like strings inside the catalog.

```json
{
  "schema": "project-governance.test-case-workflow.v1",
  "profile": "example-project",
  "catalogs": {
    "app": {
      "path": "docs/verification/app-test-cases.csv",
      "format": "csv",
      "encoding": "utf-8",
      "governance_document": "docs/verification/app-test-cases.md",
      "eligible_document_statuses": ["active"],
      "requirement_authority": "resolved",
      "columns": {
        "id": "CaseID",
        "requirement": "Requirement",
        "title": "Title",
        "steps": "Steps",
        "expected": "Expected",
        "result": "Test Result"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Required column roles are `id`, `requirement`, `title`, `steps`, `expected`,
and `result`. Optional roles are `priority`, `preconditions`, `actual`,
`execution_count`, `test_date`, `tester`, and `evidence`. Catalog and governance
document paths must resolve to existing files inside the repository. The
managed operations never write CSV results.

Run the resolver adjacent to the installed skill and pass the target repository
with `--cwd`. For v3 it validates the selected JSON task contract, returns a
small resolved state with policy references, mutability, authorization,
parameter and output schemas, exit states, and an entry command without writing
project files or a runtime cache. It never executes project code. Pass
`--operation <name>` to return only the operation needed for the current stage.
The separate task runner executes only validated argv arrays. Legacy v1/v2
resolution retains its ignored instruction cache for compatibility.

Each v3 contract uses:

```json
{
  "schema": "project-governance.task-contract.v1",
  "id": "example.defect-diagnosis.v1",
  "task": "defect-diagnosis",
  "operations": {
    "collect": {
      "description": "Collect allowlisted evidence.",
      "command": ["pnpm", "ops:collect-evidence", "--"],
      "mutability": "read_only",
      "authorization": "none",
      "parameters": {},
      "output_schema": "example.evidence.v1",
      "exit_codes": {"0": "evidence_collected"},
      "next_states": ["semantic_classification"]
    }
  }
}
```

Commands must be argv arrays. The resolver verifies executables and direct
script or pnpm entry points when possible. Every write operation must declare
`current_user` authorization. The runner additionally requires `--authorized`;
that flag is a mechanical gate and never replaces the AI's current-turn
authorization judgment.

The v2/v3 resolver requires project segment `10` through `64`, reserves `01`
through `09` for system applications, requires the standard
instance mapping, and sequential unique service identifiers beginning at `0`.
It renders the derived port for every configured environment and service.

Before writing a new v2/v3 port configuration, run:

```bash
uv run --script <skill-root>/scripts/project-segments.py allocate --cwd <project-root>
```

For a project that already has v2/v3 port configuration, register its current segment
with `claim --segment <PP>`; use `check --segment <PP>` for read-only
validation. Allocation and claim use an exclusive lock and atomic replacement.
They are idempotent for the same canonical Git root and segment, reject
cross-project conflicts, and never renumber another project. The registry
schema is `project-governance.project-segments.v1` and its allocation keys are
canonical absolute Git roots.

Project instructions may specialize terminology, authoritative sources,
history locations, commands, topology, and project-only policy. They cannot
override external authority, non-configurable safety rules, resolver
validation, or path containment. Do not store transient input, secrets,
generated output, or runtime state in project configuration.

When release or deployment uses shared host infrastructure, configure the
separate reusable skill under `.agents/skills-config/host-governance/` using
`host-governance.config.v2`. Project Governance owns the application release
contract; Host Governance owns the host-control contract. Cross-reference their
stable project, target, and resource identities, but do not embed host
inventory, shared desired state, live generations, credentials, or host
transaction journals in Project Governance configuration.
